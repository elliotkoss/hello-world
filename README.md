A place to store ideas, tutorials, and code snippets.

Code Snippets
  1.  dom_parser.php
      This is a simple parser example based on the cumulative tutorials / research I reviewed. There is a LOT of old content, and this should be the foundation for a simple DOM parser. Check out the file and comments for what I tried.

Tutorials
  1.  Github Hello World Guide
      https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
      Great resource for learning and refreshing the basics of Github.
